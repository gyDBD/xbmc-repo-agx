v1.0.5

corrected duration strings


v1.0.4
added category listings

known issues:
parsedom chokes on invalid characters. need to replace parsedom with something more elegant
this means some categories and or pages will cause the addon to crash occasionally
i'll get around to replacing parsedom some other time for now it works well enough.


v1.0.3
fixed regex that extracts video URL due to site changes 2016-09-01


v1.0.2
there is no pagination on Random Videos and trying to paginate it caused the addon to crash.


v1.0.1
Website changes broke the regex.
Switched to parseDOM and removed BeautifulSoup


v0.0.1
Initial version. Some videos don't parse, most do. Pagination works.
